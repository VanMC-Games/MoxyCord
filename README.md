## Features

MoxyCord being a fork of FlameCord, has all its features, and some of its own, such as:

* **Exploit Fixes**: FlameCord specializes in providing better server security by fixing major exploits, performance flaws and bugs that Bungeecord already has, and that have not yet been fixed in WaterfallMC.
* **Bot Protection**: FlameCord brings swift bot protection for your Minecraft server to avoid extra CPU usage and crashes in your machines.
* **Better Performance**: MoxyCord aims to improve FlameCord's performance and make your CPU lower.

## Why fork FlameCord?

MoxyCord was forked out of a desire for greater performance to be afforded to a Bungeecord-based proxy, which Waterfall currently cannot offer.

MoxyCord will track upstream FlameCord and merge changes as needed.
